## Q1. Construct and store a 4 x 2 matrix thatâ€™s filled row-wise with the values 4.3, 3.1, 
#      8.2, 8.2, 3.2, 0.9, 1.6, and 6.5, in that order.

# Solution :
mat1 <- matrix(data = c(4.3, 3.1, 8.2, 8.2, 3.2, 0.9, 1.6,  6.5) , nrow = 4 , ncol = 2 , byrow = TRUE)


## Q2. Confirm the dimensions of the matrix from (1.) are 3 x 2 if you remove any one row.

# Solution :
print(dim(mat1[-2,]) == c(3,2)) # Returns "TRUE TRUE" which means dimensions are indeed 3x2.


## Q3. Overwrite the second column of the matrix from (1.) with that same column sorted from 
#      smallest to largest.

# Solution :
mat1[,2] <- sort(x = mat1[,2])
print(mat1)


## Q4. What does R return if you delete the fourth row and the first column from (3.)? 
#      Use matrix to ensure the result is a single-column matrix, rather than a vector.

# Solution :
Result <- matrix(data = mat1[-4,-1])
print(Result) 


## Q5. Store the bottom four elements of (3.) as a new 2 x 2 matrix.

# Solution :
NewMat <- matrix(data = c(mat1[c(3,4),]) , nrow = 2 , ncol = 2)
print(NewMat)


## Q6. Overwrite, in this order, the elements of (3.) at positions (4;2), (1;2), (4;1), 
#     and (1;1) with -1/2 of the two values on the diagonal of (e).

# Solution :
-1/2*c(diag(NewMat)) -> mat1[c(4,1) , c(2,1)]
print(mat1)
